## Example Usage

```terraform

  body                 = <<-EOT
    def rule(event):
        # Check if query results exceed threshold
        failed_count = event.get('failed_login_count', 0)
        return failed_count > 10
  EOT
  severity             = "HIGH"
  description          = "Detects high volume of failed login attempts from scheduled query"
  enabled              = true
  dedup_period_minutes = 60
  threshold            = 1

  scheduled_queries = [
    "failed-login-aggregation-query"
  ]

  tags = [
    "authentication",
