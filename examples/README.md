# Examples

This directory contains examples that can be used to practically try out or test the provider and the resources it contains.
These are included under `full-examples`.
Additionally, it contains some basic example files which are also used for generating some basic documentation for the 
provider and its resources using `go generate`, which can be found in the `provider` and `resources` directories. 

### Full examples

In order to run the full examples and try out the provider you have to:

1. Build the provider as described in the main [README.md](../README.md)
2. Add a `.terraformrc` file in your home dir which contains the following:
```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "panther-labs/panther" = "{PATH}"
  }
  direct {}
}
```
where `PATH` is the path that your go binaries are located. This will either be your `GOBIN` var if it's set, or `{GOPATH}/bin`.
3. Navigate to the example directory you want to try out under `full-examples/{resource_type}`. The examples are set up so that a `variables.tf` file is created which
includes the provider level variables you need to run terraform commands (`token`, `url`). The easiest way to use these
examples is to create a `*.tfvars` file to get the values for these variables, like in the example below:
```terraform
token             = "{your_token}"
url               = "{your_url}"
integration_label = "test-label"
log_stream_type   = "Auto"
log_types = ["AWS.CloudFrontAccess"]
auth_method       = "SharedSecret"
auth_header_key   = "x-api-key"
auth_secret_value = "test-secret"
```
That way you can run terraform commands like
```shell
terraform plan -var-file="your-file.tfvars"
```
and
```shell
terraform apply -var-file="your-file.tfvars"
```
or alternatively you can provide the variables directly in the command line:
```shell
terraform plan -var="var1=value1" -var="var2=value2" ...
```

This will create actual resources in your dev environment, so make sure to run
```shell
terraform destroy -var-file="your-file.tfvars"
```
when you are done with testing, so no lingering resources are left.

Don't forget to remove the `.terraformrc` file when you are done testing and if you plan to use the released provider version. 

### Basic examples and docs generation

The document generation tool looks for files in the following locations by default. All other *.tf files besides the ones mentioned
below are ignored by the documentation tool. This is useful for creating examples that can run and/or ar testable even 
if some parts are not relevant for the documentation.

* **provider/provider.tf** example file for the provider index page
* **data-sources/`full data source name`/data-source.tf** example file for the named data source page
* **resources/`full resource name`/resource.tf** example file for the named data source page
